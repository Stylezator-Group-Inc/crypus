### What is Crypus
Crypus is a cryptocurrency that goes directly from the sender to the recipient without transactions. Crypus is in the .cry file extension. It is recommended that you send this file from Telegram Messenger. You can see it below:
```
User A -- Telegram --> User B
```
All you need is Node.js to mine Crypus. Go to Crypusâ€™s official page and download its mining software. If you want to sell your crypus coins to another person, you open a file with the extension `.cry` and copy the coins you have mined to it. Now your friend can use the coins you dug.
